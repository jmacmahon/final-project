\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
\subsubsection{BitTorrent}
BitTorrent is a protocol used for peer-to-peer data distribution (file sharing) across the Internet.  It was designed in 2001 by Bram Cohen and has been in widespread use for over a decade for a number of purposes.  Its central feature is the ability to distribute large files to many users without producing excessive load or bandwidth requirements on a central server.

When a user wants to download a file using BitTorrent, they first acquire a ``.torrent'' file, which contains some metadata: hashes, filenames and the address of a server known as a ``tracker''.  The user then contacts the tracker to announce themself, and the tracker returns a collection of addresses of other users.  The user then connects directly to these other users and downloads the data in chunks from them.

\subsubsection{Bitcoin}
Bitcoin is a fully peer-to-peer online currency, developed in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.  It uses public-private key cryptography to secure an electronic `wallet' and sign transactions of Bitcoins to other users.  There are many interesting aspects of how Bitcoin works (e.g. Bitcoin generation or `mining', macroeconomic behaviour, ethical implications of unregulated capitalism), but we will be focussing on the mechanism by which transactions are made and verified by the network.
