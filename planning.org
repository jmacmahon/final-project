* Reading
** Read in full
*** The BitTorrent Protocol Specification
Bram Cohen, 2008(?)

Describes tracker behaviour in good detail: client IDs, bencoding

*** Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric
Petar Maymounkov and David Mazi√®res, 2002

Some implementation detail.  To be optimised -- some optimisations suggested
but not in scope of paper.

Very good example of style and level of detail in writing.

** Read abstracts
*** Formaleuros, Formalbitcoins, and Virtual Monies
Formal analysis of what money is and how it works in localised environments.
Interesting but probably irrelevant to the project.

*** Questions related to Bitcoin and other Informational Money
Follow-up of previous paper and Bitcoin and Beyond.  Collection of questions,
some related to security, some less relevant.

*** An Analysis of Anonymity in the Bitcoin System
In the title.  Focus on network analysis -- could be useful for techniques to
analyse other things.  We're not that interested in anonymity (in fact we don't
want it).

*** On Bitcoin and Red Balloons
Incentivising broadcast of transactions in Bitcoin.  I suspect we won't need
this (since cheating would happen by other means than not broadcasting?) but
might be good to check.

*** Analysis of Bitcoin Pooled Mining Reward Systems
We won't be mining anything.

*** Traveling the Silk Road: A measurement analysis of a large anonymous online marketplace
Interesting but not related to the project.  Could be useful for ethical
considerations.

*** Homomorphic Payment Addresses and the Pay-to-Contract Protocol
Proposal of a payment protocol over Bitcoin.  Definitely worth investigating,
although requires (somehow) an asymmetric relationship between peers.

*** Bitcoin and Beyond: Exclusively Informational Money
Theoretical analysis of Bitcoin as informational money.  Possibly too technical
for me to understand, also possibly not relevant to the project.
