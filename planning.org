** The BitTorrent Protocol Specification
Bram Cohen, 2008(?)

Describes tracker behaviour in good detail: client IDs, bencoding

** Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric
Petar Maymounkov and David Mazi√®res, 2002

Some implementation detail.  To be optimised -- some optimisations suggested
but not in scope of paper.

Very good example of style and level of detail in writing.
